At Tech Corp, I primarily used Django for building REST APIs that served over 100,000 daily active users. I really appreciate Django's batteries-included philosophy - the ORM makes database relationships intuitive, and the admin interface saves so much development time. I've also worked extensively with Flask, particularly at StartupXYZ where we built microservices. The main difference I've noticed is that Django is more opinionated and comes with more built-in features, while Flask gives you more flexibility to choose your components."

Leadership was relatively new to me when I started, but I focused on establishing clear communication channels and creating a supportive environment. I implemented daily standups to track progress and identify blockers early. What really made a difference was setting up regular one-on-ones with each team member to understand their career goals and challenges. For the microservices coordination, I created shared documentation standards and established API contracts between services."

We started noticing response times degrading during peak hours - some endpoints were taking up to 2 seconds. First, I implemented comprehensive monitoring using New Relic and custom metrics to identify the bottlenecks. The data showed that 60% of our slow queries were coming from the user activity tracking system. I discovered we had several N+1 query problems where we were making hundreds of individual database calls instead of using proper joins. I refactored these using Django's select_related and prefetch_related. Next, I implemented Redis caching for frequently accessed data like user profiles and product catalogs."
